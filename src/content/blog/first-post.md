summary: An honest introduction to who I am, how I use AI in my writing, and why this blog might be worth your time.

First thing that needs to be said is that this blog post was not written by AI — which is exactly the sort of thing someone using AI _would_ say — but no, really, unfortunately, it’s all me — even all these em dashes, which were my jam long before AI came along and ruined them for everyone. Now, I wish I could guarantee this for you, but with the way AI has evolved, it’s getting harder to tell what is human written and what is not. Best I can do is justify why I’d be qualified enough, as a junior developer, to write blog posts in the first place.

So who am I? Well, my name is Jose Ramirez. I’m 28 years old, with a computer science degree from Boston University. I’m probably older than most junior developers you’ll meet, and that’s because I took the scenic route in life: I dropped out of university at 18 to chase a writing career — unsuccessfully, I might add. It’s that context that I hope will instill you, dear reader, with a sense of trust in my writing… perhaps even more than in my code 😅.

So why am I writing this? Partly because I’ve always liked the idea of having a little corner of the internet where I can yell into the void about code, life, and whatever else is rattling around in my head. But mostly because I’ve noticed that a lot of developer blogs are either AI garbage or overly technical — both of which bore me to death. I want this to be more like pulling up a chair next to me while I’m working, hearing the unfiltered thought process, my bad takes, and the “oh wait, that actually worked” moments. And since we’re doing full transparency here, I’ll admit: AI is being used to help me write these blogs, but not in the way you think.

See, when I say AI is helping me write these, I don’t mean I’m pasting “Write a blog post about X” into ChatGPT and hitting publish. That’s lazy — and it defeats the point. Instead, I treat AI like an editor who works for free, and doesn’t get offended when I delete 90% of what it writes. The workflow is simple: I write a paragraph, feed it to AI, and it gives me suggestions. I take what I like, throw out what I don’t, and repeat. It’s still my voice and my ideas — just a little sharper after going through the machine.

I hope this comes across as a win-win. Without that help, I could still write these blog posts — it would just take a lot longer, and I’d probably miss plenty of grammar mistakes and typos. That’s always been a weakness of mine as a writer, and having a free editor goes a long way.

So, what can you actually expect from this blog? For one, the posts won’t be consistent in length — it’s entirely topic-specific. I could write a novel on Neovim alone, but if you ask me about Emacs, you’d be lucky to get a paragraph.

As for how often I’ll post, I’m aiming for quality over quantity, so you won’t see daily updates. Realistically, expect one or two posts a month, depending on how much free time I can steal from work, side projects, and having a social life (yes, I do occasionally leave my keyboard). Topics will range from developer tips and technical deep-dives to rants about the industry, personal experiences, and the occasional completely unnecessary tangent. Basically: if you like discussing tech with a human voice, you’ll probably feel at home here.

So that’s the pitch. If any of this sounds interesting — or at least mildly entertaining — stick around. Worst case, you can get a free laugh at my expense. Best case, you pick up something useful along the way. Either way, welcome.
